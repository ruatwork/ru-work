# RU@work
This repository is for the "Monialaprojekti" course in Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences.

## Goal of the project
The goal of the project is to create a work time tracking system that uses Wi-Fi connectivity to automatically mark workers as present or absent. The project will mainly be written in Python, and will use MariaDB to its advantage.

Further documentation will be written as the project progresses.

A blog exists for the project at https://ruatwork.wordpress.com/

## Miscellaneous

The project is developed by three students: Roope Varttila, Jaakko Veijonen and Vili Viita.

It is planned to test the project in real work environments during Spring 2019.
